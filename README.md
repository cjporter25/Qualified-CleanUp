# Text Parser Extension

## Overview

This is a simple browser extension that helps clean up copied chat logs or transcribed conversations by removing repeated lines that follow a specific timestamped format. 

It is compatible with modern desktop browsers that support Manifest V3, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari (via Xcode conversion).

## Features

- Opens a popup with a text input box labeled "Qualified CleanUp"
- Parses text to remove duplicate lines that repeat immediately after a timestamped line
- Example of what gets cleaned:

-   At 10:01 am I say: Got it, thank you
    Got it, thank you

-   Becomes:

-   At 10:01 am I say: Got it, thank you


- Displays the cleaned output below the input box
- Provides a "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the cleaned text
- Automatically saves and restores both input and output even after the popup is closed

1. Paste the raw text into the first text box.
2. Click **"Parse"** to clean it.
